# Activate the environment (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate


Install Dependencies

Install the necessary libraries listed in the requirements.txt file (which is also available in the Canvas):

pip install -r requirements.txt


Running the Application
Set Environment Variables

Create a file named .env in the root directory to store sensitive configuration (database credentials, JWT secret key, etc.).

# Example .env content:
SECRET_KEY="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY_HERE"
DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./shubhyatra.db"

Run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn. Assuming your main file is main.py and the app instance is named app:

uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload


The server will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
